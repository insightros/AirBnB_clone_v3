# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

Holberton School's AirBnB project breaks down high-level programming into parts. The main goal is to create an HBnB website server. The first part builds a command interpreter for handling HBnB website objects.

## Functionalities of the command interpreter:

- Create a new object
- Retrieve an object from a file, database...
- Perform operations on objects
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Go to AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
- Run HBNB(Interactive): `./console` and enter command
- Run HBNB(Non-Interactive): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`
